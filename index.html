       <p>Dogs are awesome My pet friend is a dog. It would make the best pet because a dog makes you feel more
          protected compared to other pets. Getting a dog as a pet is the best thing to do because, it will 
          always be there for you when you are sad, they make excellent companion. You can take the dog for a 
          walk or to the park A dog will play with you when he or she sees that  you are bored. You can train 
          them and teach them tricks.It will always be kind to you, and lick your face and be happy and show 
          you how much they miss you.It will alert you when something bad happens and unusual stuff going on
         in your house.It will be with you when you are lonely and lay next to you and follow you everywhere 
         you go. It will always love you  just like you love him or her no matter what you do.
